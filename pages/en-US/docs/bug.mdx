## Suggested Process for Submitting Issues

To ensure that your feedback can be processed quickly, please follow the steps below:

### 1. **Search for Existing Issues**
Before submitting an issue, please check if your problem has already been reported by other users:
- Visit the [issue list](https://github.com/CodePhiliaX/fastexcel/issues) and search for keywords.
- If a similar issue is found, **comment and provide detailed information** under that issue instead of creating a new one.

This can help avoid duplicate problems and improve the efficiency of issue handling.

### 2. **Create a New Issue**
If you confirm that your issue has not been reported, please submit a new issue through the [NEW ISSUE](https://github.com/CodePhiliaX/fastexcel/issues/new/choose) page.

- **Please try to use the issue template** to ensure complete information is provided, such as:
  - Environment where the issue occurred (system, version, etc.).
  - Steps to reproduce.
  - Error logs or screenshots.
