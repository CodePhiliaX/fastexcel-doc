### Workspace Preparation

Ensure you have a GitHub account and complete the local development environment setup by following these steps:
1. **Fork the repository**: Click the `Fork` button on fastexcel's [GitHub page](https://github.com/CodePhiliaX/fastexcel) to copy the project to your GitHub account, for example: `https://github.com/<your-username>/fastexcel`.
2. **Clone the repository**: Run the following command to clone the forked project to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/fastexcel.git
   ```
3. **Set up the upstream repository**: Set the official repository as `upstream` for easy synchronization:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:CodePhiliaX/fastexcel.git
   git remote set-url --push upstream no-pushing
   ```
   Running `git remote -v` can check if the configuration is correct.

- **release branches**: Used for version releases (e.g., `0.6.0`, `0.6.1`).
- **feature branches**: Used for developing larger features.
- **hotfix branches**: Used for fixing critical bugs.

When submitting a PR, ensure the changes are based on the `main` branch.

### Commit Rules

#### Commit Message
Ensure the commit message is clear and descriptive, following this format:
- **docs**: Update documentation, for example, `docs: Update PR submission guide`.
- **feature**: New feature, for example, `feature: Support concurrent writing`.
- **bugfix**: Fix bug, for example, `bugfix: Fix null pointer exception`.

If you need help, refer to [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

#### Commit Content
Each commit should contain complete and reviewable changes, ensuring:
- Avoid overly large changes in a single commit.
- Each commit content is independent and can pass CI tests.

Also, ensure the correct Git user information is configured when committing:
```bash
git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email
```
