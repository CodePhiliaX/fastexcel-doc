## Installation

The table below lists the minimum requirements of FastExcel base library versions for Java language:

| Version | JDK Version Support Range | Remarks                            |
|---------|:--------------------------:|------------------------------------|
| 1.0.0+  | JDK 8 - JDK 21              | Currently on the master branch, fully compatible with easyexcel |

We strongly recommend using the latest version of FastExcel, as performance optimizations, bug fixes, and new features in the latest version will make your usage more convenient.

> FastExcel currently uses poi as the underlying package. If your project already has related poi components, you need to manually exclude the poi-related jar files.

### Maven
If you are using Maven for project building, include the following configuration in the `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>cn.idev.excel</groupId>
    <artifactId>fastexcel</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
### Gradle
If you are using Gradle for project building, include the following configuration in the `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'cn.idev.excel:fastexcel:1.0.0'
}
```
## Differences Between EasyExcel and FastExcel
_ 1. FastExcel supports all functions of EasyExcel, but FastExcel has better performance and stability.
_ 2. FastExcel has the same API as EasyExcel and can be seamlessly switched.
_ 3. FastExcel will continue to be updated, fixing bugs, optimizing performance, and adding new features.

## How to Upgrade from EasyExcel to FastExcel

### 1. Modify Dependencies
Replace the dependency of EasyExcel with the dependency of FastExcel as follows:
```xml
<!-- easyexcel dependency -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba</groupId>
    <artifactId>easyexcel</artifactId>
    <version>xxxx</version>
</dependency>
```
replace with
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>cn.idev.excel</groupId>
    <artifactId>fastexcel</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Modify Code
Replace the package name of EasyExcel with the package name of FastExcel as follows:
```java
// Replace the package name of easyexcel with the package name of FastExcel
import com.alibaba.excel.**;
```
replace with
```java
import cn.idev.excel.**;
```
### 3. Directly Depend on FastExcel without Modifying Code
If for various reasons you do not want to modify the code, you can directly depend on FastExcel and then directly depend on FastExcel in the `pom.xml` file.
EasyExcel and FastExcel can coexist, but it is recommended to replace EasyExcel with FastExcel in the long term.

### 4. Recommend Using FastExcel Class in the Future
For compatibility reasons, the EasyExcel class has been retained, but it is recommended to use the FastExcel class in the future. The FastExcel class is the entry class of FastExcel, which includes all the functions of the EasyExcel class, and any new features will only be added to the FastExcel class in the future.
