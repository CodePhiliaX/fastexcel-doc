# Installation

The following table shows the minimum Java version requirements for different versions of EasyExcel-Plus:

| Version | JDK Version Support | Notes                                        |
|---------|:------------------:|----------------------------------------------|
| 4.0.0+  | jdk8 - jdk21      | Current master branch, fully compatible with easyexcel |
| 5.0.0+  | jdk8 - jdk21      | Next generation version, removes POI dependency |

We strongly recommend using the latest version of EasyExcel-Plus, as the performance optimizations, bug fixes, and new features in the latest version will make your usage more convenient.

> Since EasyExcel-Plus uses POI as its underlying package, if you are using version 4+ and your project already has POI-related components, you need to manually exclude the POI-related jar packages.

If you use Maven for project building, please add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba</groupId>
    <artifactId>easyexcel</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

If you use Gradle for project building, please add the following configuration to your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.alibaba:easyexcel:4.0.3'
}
```
