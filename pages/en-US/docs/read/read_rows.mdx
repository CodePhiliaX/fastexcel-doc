## Reading the First Few Lines of an Excel File with FastExcel
### Overview

In the process of data analysis and processing, quickly viewing the contents of the first few lines of an Excel file can help us better understand the data structure and content. This article will introduce how to use FastExcel to read the first 100 rows of an Excel file.
You can specify the number of rows to read using the numRows method. By setting numRows(100), you can read the first 100 rows of data. By default, FastExcel reads all the data in the entire Excel file, but you can limit the number of rows read by setting the numRows method.
The row count starts from 0, where 0 indicates no limit on the number of rows to read, meaning it will read all rows. For example, setting numRows(100) means reading the first 100 rows of data, including the header row.

### 1. Read the First 100 Rows of All Sheets
#### Code

```java
EasyExcel.read(fileName, DemoData.class, new PageReadListener<DemoData>(dataList -> {
    for (DemoData demoData : dataList) {
        log.info("Read one piece of data {}", JSON.toJSONString(demoData));
    }
})).numRows(100).sheet().doRead();
```

### Read the First 100 Rows of a Single Sheet

```java
try (ExcelReader excelReader = EasyExcel.read(fileName, DemoData.class, new DemoDataListener()).build()) {
    // Build a sheet where you can specify the name or number
    ReadSheet readSheet = EasyExcel.readSheet(0).build();
    readSheet.setNumRows(100);
    // Read a sheet
    excelReader.read(readSheet);
}
```
